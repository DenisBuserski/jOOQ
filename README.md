# Java Object Oriented Querying(jOOQ)

This is a simple demo of how jOOQ(Java Object Oriented Querying) works. I tried out several SQL statements(Create database, create table, insert, delete and select statements).

If you want to explore more of the jOOQ, you can vist their [website](https://www.jooq.org/). Also you can find most of the SQL queries [here](https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/).
