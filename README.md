# Java Object Oriented Querying(jOOQ)

I decided to try out jOOQ(Java Object Oriented Querying) and made a simple program where I insert and fetch data from the Database. The 2 methods, which I have "insertData" and "selectStatement" are pretty simple, since my goal was to see how jOOQ works. 

## Try it our on your machine
1. Start by making a database "java_jooq"
2. Create "users" table inside "java_jooq"
3. Or you can just run (setup.sql)[https://github.com/DenisBuserski/jOOQ/blob/main/java-jooq/src/main/resources/setup.sql]

4. 
You can also find most of the SQL queries https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/
