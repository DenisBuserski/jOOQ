# Java Object Oriented Querying(jOOQ)

I decided to try out jOOQ(Java Object Oriented Querying) and made a simple program where I insert and fetch data from the Database. The 2 methods, which I have "insertData" and "selectStatement" are pretty simple, since my goal was to see how jOOQ works. In my case I used MySQL, but you can use others as well.

## Try it our on your machine

1. Clone the repository
1. Start by making a database "java_jooq"
2. Create "users" table inside "java_jooq"
3. Or you can just run [setup.sql](java-jooq/src/main/resources/setup.sql)
4. Enjoy!

If you want ot explore more of the jOOQ, you can vist their (website)[https://www.jooq.org/]. Also you can find most of the SQL queries here https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/
